# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-using-ANN | MNIST Dataset
This project demonstrates how to build a Handwritten Digit Classification model using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) on the MNIST dataset. The model will predict the digit (from 0 to 9) in a given handwritten image.

### In this project, we use the MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits, to build and train a neural network. The task is to classify the digits correctly using a multi-class classification approach. The model is implemented using Keras, TensorFlow, and Python.
